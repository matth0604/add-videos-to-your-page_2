	Abstraction: Helps avoid repetition in code by defining "Classes" of "Objects" with similar properties.  This "Object-Oriented" style of programming also allows us to think about programs in a way that we are familiar with.  Even though HTML and CSS are not object oriented languages, abstract thinking is present in all of them. In HTML, head element contains data that apply to each other element (like charset) and thus do not need to be repeated. Attributes like class are then used in CSS to apply one style definition to all tags which contain that class. This is actually quite similar to python classes which "apply" defined variables and methods to all object of that class.
	CSS provides style, HTML presents information, and Python is like the brain that can to do some server-side things, perform calculations, general programming, or use it with a database to create a dynamic website.
<p>
	Object Oriented Programming(OOP):  Object-oriented programming is a programming language model organized around "objects" rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. Historically, a program has been viewed as a logical procedure that takes input data, processes it, and produces output data. A type of programming in which programmers define not only the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure. In this way, the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions. In addition, programmers can create relationships between one object and another. For example, objects can inherit characteristics from other objects.
One of the principal advantages of object-oriented programming techniques over procedural programming techniques is that they enable programmers to create modules that do not need to be changed when a new type of object is added. A programmer can simply create a new object that inherits many of its features from existing objects. This makes object-oriented programs easier to modify. 

<p>
	Module:  A file of prewritten code that is imported.  Can also have packages which is a module that contains submodules.

<p>
	Classes: A "class" is like a blueprint for a building
<p>
	Instance: Is like an ACTUAL building that was made from the blueprint.
<p>
	Instance Methods:  Are special functions that belong to an "instance" of a "class."  They usually get or set information about the instance they are attached to.
<p>	
	Instance Variable:   A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.
<p>
	Inheritance:  When you use inheritance, you figure out what seemingly different things have in common and then capture that commanailty in a "parent" class.  One class basically gains all the attributes of another class.  
<p>	
	Method Overriding:  In Python method overriding occours simply defining in the child class a method with the same name of a method in the parent class. When you define a method in the object you make this latter able to satisfy that method call, so the implementations of its ancestors do not come in play.
<p>
	Python Libraries: The Python Standard Library contains hundreds of modules for interacting with the operating system, interpreter, and Internet.  These save a lot of time as you can use these modules and focus solely on the program we are writing.
<p>
	Google Style Guide: is a guide to have a common vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you are saying rather than how you are saying it.
